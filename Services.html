            <h1>How it Works:</h1>
            <h2>A typical project begins with an initial consultation via email or phone to discuss your website’s needs. Following this conversation, I will send a proposal outlining the project details, costs, and timeline. If accepted, the proposal will serve as the contract. A 50% deposit will be invoiced, and work will commence once payment is received.

                For custom web design projects, I will reach out after completing the homepage and one inner page to get your approval before proceeding with the rest of the site. Upon project completion, up to three rounds of revisions will be included, provided they fall within the scope of the contract. Once you're satisfied with the final result, the project will be considered complete, and the remaining 50% balance will be invoiced.</h2>
